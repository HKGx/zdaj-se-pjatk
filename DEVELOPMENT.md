## Setup

To run the app you will need [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed on your machine. Then run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

The next step is creating a `.env` file in the project's root. Its content should mirror the `.env.example`.

Now you should be able to run the app with:

```
yarn start
```

## Preview

You can also run a preview of the built app, which starts a server in the `dist` folder:

```
yarn build
yarn preview
```

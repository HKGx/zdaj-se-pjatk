Encryption and decryption allow secure transfer of information between an Internet\nbrowser and server.\n\nThe Point to Point Protocol [RFC1661] is a layer 2 protocol. It is widely used to connect\ntwo sets of nodes. The encryption functionality in PPP is called ECP (Encryption\nControl Protocol) [RFC1968]. This protocol allows the use of the encryption in PPP\nframe but limits the key exchange.\n\nIf, for example, an Internet user submits his credit card data to an online store, a hacker may be able to intercept the physically transmitted data. But with the appropriate encryption, the hacker won't be able to decipher the data, which makes the entire interception useless.\n\nI feel like PPP is for something else, not interception.
